# PDF-Splitter
# ðŸ§¾ PDF Intake Splitter for Consent Packets

This Python script automates the process of splitting a signed intake packet (multi-page PDF) into individual form files. It was developed for a nonprofit agency to streamline uploading documentation into Salesforce CRM, but it can be adapted for any organization that collects and processes signed form packets.

## ðŸ“˜ Background & Purpose

At our agency, parents receive a single electronically signable PDF packet containing multiple required forms (e.g. medical consent, placement agreement, media release). Once completed, these signed packets need to be:

1. Split into individual forms
2. Properly renamed to reflect the childâ€™s name and form title
3. Uploaded into our Salesforce CRM under the correct program enrollment

Manually doing this for every intake packet was time-consuming and prone to error. This script automates that process, cutting down on administrative work and ensuring consistency in file naming and structure.

## âœ¨ Features

- Automatically splits a multi-page signed PDF into individual form documents
- Renames each file with the childâ€™s name and the specific form title
- Organizes outputs into folders by child for ease of upload into CRM
- Reduces manual work and human error

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- [PyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/) â€“ for PDF reading/writing
- [pycryptodome](https://pypi.org/project/pycryptodome/) â€“ to handle encrypted PDFs (required by some e-signing tools)

---

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Make sure you have Python 3 installed, then install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install PyPDF2 pycryptodome


**ðŸš€ How to Use**

1. Place all signed intake PDFs in an input_forms folder. Filenames should begin with the childâ€™s name:
          jane_doe.intake.pdf
          john_smith.intake.pdf

2. Update these paths in the Python script:
input_folder = r"C:\path\to\input_forms"
output_folder = r"C:\path\to\output_forms"

3. Run the script:
python split_child_forms.py

4. Each childâ€™s folder will be created in output_forms/, containing:
/output_forms/
â””â”€â”€ Jane Doe/
    â”œâ”€â”€ Jane Doe.MEDIA RELEASE AND CONSENT FOR MINORS.pdf
    â”œâ”€â”€ Jane Doe.PLACEMENT AGREEMENT.pdf
    â”œâ”€â”€ ...

5. These files can now be easily matched to Salesforce records and uploaded accordingly.

**ðŸ§  How It Works**
The script uses a form_map dictionary to define which pages in the packet correspond to which forms. Example:
form_map = {
    "MEDIA RELEASE AND CONSENT FOR MINORS": [0],
    "PLACEMENT AGREEMENT": [1, 2, 3],
    ...
}
This mapping reflects the static layout of the PDF packet. You can easily edit it if your agency changes the packet format in the future.
